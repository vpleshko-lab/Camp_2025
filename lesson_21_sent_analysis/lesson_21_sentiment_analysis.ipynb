      "there might've been a pretty decent teen mind-fuck movie in here somewhere , but i guess \" the suits \" decided that turning it into a music video with little edge , would make more sense . \n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Evolution of Sentiment Analysis**:\n",
    "   - Traditional methods (BoW, TF-IDF) provide baselines and are still useful for simple tasks\n",
    "   - Word embeddings capture semantic relationships\n",
    "   - Transformer models provide state-of-the-art performance\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Trade-offs**:\n",
    "   - Computational resources vs. accuracy\n",
    "   - Training time vs. performance\n",
    "   - Model size vs. inference speed\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Choosing the Right Approach**:\n",
    "   - For simple applications with limited resources: TF-IDF + classical ML\n",
    "   - For moderate complexity: Word embeddings + neural networks\n",
    "   - For maximum accuracy: Fine-tuned transformer models\n",
    "   - For specialized applications: Zero-shot or few-shot learning\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Beyond Binary Sentiment**:\n",
    "   - Emotion detection\n",
    "   - Aspect-based sentiment analysis\n",
    "   - Stance detection\n",
    "   - Sarcasm and irony detection\n"
